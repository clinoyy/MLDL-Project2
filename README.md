### Problem Defination and Analysis

    - Aims to predict whether a customer will accept a personal loan based on their financial and demographic attributes.
    - Identifying key features like income, age, and credit usage for loan acceptance and to build an effective classification model.

    - This can be helpful for bank sectors for better marketing, they can target people who have high probablity of loan acceptance. Also, bank can understand customer behavior and take some descision from it.

    - Machine learning is an ideal solution because we have data set which is large enough to find exisiting pattern and with the given feature we will be easily able to classify by using various ML Classification algorithm as we want to classify wether person will take a loan or not (yes or no)
